# Windows Sentinel

Project to replace Windows Task Scheduler with a python application to run
Windows commands asynchronously.

[The source for this project is available here][src].

Right now, to configure the scripts to run, create a Command object in the tasks
list in ``__main__.py``.  These will be run when the script is run.
